# Hello ~~darkness my old friend~~ there 👋

ℹ️ My name is Andrey. [Rockstar wannabe](https://notsoalive.goncharov.page/) -> coding monkey at Meta -> ML-padawan at Skoltech. 

🧪 Research interests are in the "philosophy" of DL. Eager to learn why DL models are the way they are (think mech interp, emergent abilities, alignment, uncertainty and complexity estimation and etc). On the other hand, as a performance geek I could never resist a good puzzle on trying to make systems fast and efficient.

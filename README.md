# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:information_source: My name is Andrey G. I am a software engineer from London, UK. Primarily, I am a full-stack web developer (think React, Angular, Node.js), but I also have a keen interest in low-level stuff (hello, C) and finance (love-hate relationship with Pandas).

> G. stands for Goncharov. I wanted to save you the pain of reading my Cyrillic last name.

:briefcase: Full-stack (web, blockchain, and even a bit of embedded) at software consultancies ([DSR](https://en.dsr-corporation.com/), [DataArt](https://www.dataart.com/)) :arrow_right: Headed front-end development at [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) :arrow_right: Front-end at [Bricks](https://www.thebricks.com/) (next-gen spreadsheet web app) :arrow_right: Full-time maintainer of [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) at [Meta (ex-Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/).

:memo: I write about tech in my [small blog](https://blog.goncharov.page/). 

:microphone: Occasionally, I [speak at conferences](https://github.com/aigoncharov/talks).

:mortar_board: I am currently pursuing a [Master's in Computer Science (OMSCS) from Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/).

:heart: I love math, physics, rational thinking, and figuring out how things work. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, boxing, and weight lifting.
